## Computer Code
This is the control program in the computer, written by C++ using Visual Studio 2015 & OpenCV 2.4.9.
The input of the program is the image sequences captured by a camera connected to the computer.
The output of the program is the character transmitted to the MSP430 via bluetooth.

Some codes are referenced from the internet. (But I have forgotten where exactly those are from.)
