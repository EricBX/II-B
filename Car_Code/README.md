## Car Code
This is the code of MSP 430 single-chip.
The input is the characters transmitted from the computer via bluetooth.
The output is the running mode of the car, including 'Forward', 'Backward', 'TurnLeft', 'TurnRight' and so on.
The different running mode is implemented by writting different value to the different pins of the MSP 430 single-chip.

The code is simple and coarse. And the control strategy is similar to '0-1' control.
